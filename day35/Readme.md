Debouncing Circuit

A FPGA or prototyping board contains many switch and push buttons. 
When a switch is toggled it bounce back and forth for sometimes before it settles. 
These bounces may lead to glitches in the waveform. This is usually for 20ms and then settles down. 
In this situation, the debouncing circuits are used to remove the glitches.
